                <h4 class="ui inverted header">House Rules</h4>
                <p>We play "King of the Hill" in all games. The player who is first to reach or exceed the target victory point total for the edition being played must keep the highest point total while the rest of the players complete their turns around the board. If another player can tie or beat the current leader before it returns to them, gameplay continues.</p>
                <p>We play "Foreign Island Discovery" in all Seafarer expansion games, unless the map dictates otherwise. When you build your first settlement on a foreign island, you earn two chits and place them underneath the settlement. That settlement is worth 3 victory points. Additional settlements you build on that island do not earn chits.</p>

                <p>If you're feeling terrible about your last game, and aren't sure if you want to keep humiliating yourself in front of your friends and family, just remember - there's likely plenty of time to sulk and drink alcohol until you completely f*ck up the next game.</p>
